    title: "Adding money in and out",
    body: "Use Quick add on the Home screen — type it the way you'd say it, like \"20 fuel\" or \"150 client deposit\", and include a few words so it files correctly. Or tap New for a full form, where you can also photograph a receipt to have it read for you. Everything you add waits in Review until you approve it — nothing is recorded behind your back.",
  },
  {
    title: "Scanning receipts",
    body: "On the New screen, take a photo of a receipt and the AI reads the amount, date and a suggested category. You review and approve it. To scan several at once, use Bulk receipts on the Home screen. AI uses your own OpenRouter key and never invents figures.",
  },
  {
    title: "Mileage",
    body: "On the Miles screen, enter the distance and the rate you're entitled to use — check your tax authority's current rates and rules first, as eligibility varies and not everyone can claim mileage. You can also track a trip with GPS while you drive.",
  },
  {
    title: "Invoices and getting paid",
    body: "Create invoices and quotes under Invoices, save them as PDF, and share them by email, WhatsApp, or a QR code your client can scan for the payment details. You can set up recurring invoices and send reminders for overdue ones.",
  },
  {
    title: "Tax and HMRC",
    body: "The Tax pot tells you roughly how much to set aside. Provisional statements (Settings → Provisional statements) give you a P&L and, in the UK, an SA103 summary you can hand to an accountant. Making Tax Digital filing is under Settings → MTD. All figures are provisional — check them with a qualified accountant.",
  },
  {
    title: "Backups — important",
    body: "Your books live encrypted on this device. If you lose the device with no backup, they're gone. Use Settings → Backup to save an encrypted copy to a file, your own cloud, or (coming soon) our server. Back up your receipts too, from the File Cabinet.",
  },
  {
    title: "Your accountant",
    body: "Flag any transactions you want to discuss, then use Settings → Your accountant to download a pack (SA103 + statements + transactions) to send them.",

const FAQ: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Is LedgerJack really free?", a: "Yes. Every feature is free. Contributions are voluntary and nothing is paywalled." },
  { q: "Where is my data kept?", a: "Encrypted on your device. There is no server that can read it, and your data is never sold. You choose where backups go." },
  { q: "Is this tax advice?", a: "No. LedgerJack helps you organise your books and estimate your tax. Figures are provisional — check important numbers with a qualified accountant, and confirm your obligations with HMRC." },
  { q: "What if I forget my password?", a: "Use your recovery key on the lock screen to set a new password. Without your recovery key or a backup, encrypted data can't be recovered — that's the trade-off of true privacy." },
  { q: "Does the AI cost me money?", a: "Only if you use it, and only on your own OpenRouter key. The AI panel shows your spend. You can also work entirely without AI." },
  { q: "Is it HMRC-recognised?", a: "Not yet. Don't rely on it as recognised software until it appears on GOV.UK's list." },
  { q: "Can my accountant use it?", a: "You can send them a clean pack (SA103 + statements + transactions) today. A live accountant view is planned once the optional server is available." },
