/**
 * diagnostics — builds a plain-text problem report the user can read in full
 * before deciding to share it.
 *
 * DESIGN PRINCIPLE (borrowed from how resilient payment rails are described):
 * separate a "technical" failure — something wrong in the machinery that the
 * user can't see or explain — from a "business" one they caused and understand.
 * The technical signal is the useful one, and it's exactly what a solo
 * maintainer with no analytics and no server is otherwise blind to.
 *
 * HARD RULE: this report contains diagnostics ONLY. It never reads transaction
 * contents, descriptions, amounts, client names, memos or any ledger data. It
 * counts and categorises; it does not quote. And nothing leaves the device
 * until the user has seen the whole thing and chosen to share it themselves —
 * the same idea as checking the payee's name before the money moves.
