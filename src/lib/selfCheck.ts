/**
 * selfCheck — an "andon" for your books.
 *
 * Borrowed from Toyota's Jidoka idea: a machine that detects its own defects
 * and raises a flag, rather than quietly carrying on producing bad parts. Two
 * real bugs in this app were *silent* failures — a summary card that showed
 * £0.00 for weeks without complaining, and a save that failed behind a generic
 * message. A wrong number that looks confident is worse than a visible error.
 *
 * So this module actively inspects the stored data and reports what it finds.
 * It only reads; it never modifies anything.
