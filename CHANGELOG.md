# Changelog

All notable changes to LedgerJack are recorded here. Security-relevant changes
are marked **[security]**. This project follows Semantic Versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Unit test suite (Vitest) in `tests/`, run with `npm test`, covering the
  money/tax/date logic, the problem-report privacy guarantee, AI review-gating,
  and backup KDF backward compatibility.
- GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): type-check, lint, test and
  build on every push and pull request.
- Weekly dependency vulnerability audit workflow (`.github/workflows/audit.yml`).
- **Report a problem** screen: gathers technical, non-personal diagnostics the
  user reviews in full before choosing to share them (copy or GitHub issue). The
  report never contains transaction contents.
- Deadline calendar: downloadable `.ics` of MTD and Self Assessment dates that
  the user's own calendar app reminds them about — no server, works offline.
- AI confidence scores: receipt scans below a confidence threshold are flagged
  for human review rather than presented as fact.
- Demo/example data loader (refuses to run on a non-empty ledger; only removes
  its own tagged rows).
- "Is LedgerJack right for you?" card that honestly points people to other tools
  when a better fit exists.
- Provisional figures page: shows the user's own tax-year totals and links to
  HMRC's own tax calculator (we do not calculate tax).
- `GOVERNANCE.md` and an OpenSSF badge answer sheet in `docs/`.

### Changed
- **[security]** Encrypted-backup key derivation raised from 210,000 to 600,000
  PBKDF2 iterations, matching the local vault. Versioned via the blob's `v`
  field so existing 210k backups still open. This is the artefact users copy to
  cloud storage, where offline brute-force is the threat — it should have the
  strongest derivation, not the weakest.
- Removed Google Drive / Dropbox / iCloud "coming soon" backup destinations in
  favour of a reminder to keep a weekly copy off-device via the OS share sheet.
  The app connects to no cloud account, so it can leak none.
- Backup export button relabelled and explained honestly: it was labelled
  "encrypted" but produced partly-plaintext JSON. Users are now directed to the
  passphrase-encrypted export for anything leaving the device.
- **The app no longer holds any tax rates.** CIS deduction rate, VAT rate and the
  tax-pot set-aside percentage are all user-entered, with a "check with your
  accountant / GOV.UK" warning. Removed hardcoded UK tax bands, the CIS rate
  table, and 28 stale foreign mileage rates. Rationale: a stale rate asserted
  with the app's authority is worse than no rate at all.

### Fixed
- **[security]** At-rest encryption no longer awaits WebCrypto inside a Dexie
  transaction (which silently aborted saves); encryption now happens before the
  transaction opens.
- Approved-transactions query used an IndexedDB boolean index, which cannot exist
  — it silently returned nothing, breaking monthly totals and eight other
  features. Replaced with a JS filter.
- At-rest amounts fall back to plaintext (not `£0`) when the vault is locked, so a
  locked vault never silently shows zeroes.
- Missing `ReportProblem` import in `App.tsx` that broke the production build.

### Security
- Self-check / health panel surfaces silent failures (unbalanced books,
  unreadable records, stale backups) rather than letting them pass unnoticed.
