# LedgerJack — Pre-Launch Checklist

Everything on the build roadmap is done and self-tested. This is the single list
of what stands between "built" and "safe to give real users." Grouped by who does
it and how blocking it is.

## A. Blocking — must do before a public launch

- [ ] **HMRC recognition.** Not yet on GOV.UK's recognised MTD-software list.
      Do NOT describe the app as HMRC-recognised until it is. (Owner pursues.)
- [ ] **Independent security review.** No external audit yet. Get one before
      handling real users' tax data at scale — focus on the crypto vault, backups,
      biometric, and the HMRC relay.
- [ ] **Browser smoke-test the whole app** (`npm install && npm run dev`).
      All verification so far is static analysis + logic self-tests; nothing has
      been run in a real browser from this build environment.
- [ ] **Deploy the HMRC relay** (`supabase/functions/hmrc-relay`) to your own
      Supabase project and set ALLOWED_ORIGINS. Do the same for `ai-proxy` if used.

## B. Verify external facts (may be stale — flagged in code/docs)

- [ ] HMRC **MTD Income Tax** endpoint paths + `Accept` version headers.
- [ ] HMRC **VAT (MTD)** endpoint version (9-box field names cross-checked vs
      github.com/hmrc/vat-api, but confirm the current API version).
- [ ] **OpenRouter** model slugs and prices (Opus 4.8, Fable 5, GPT-4o family) —
      verify on openrouter.ai/models.
- [ ] **CIS** deduction rates (20% / 30% / 0%).
- [ ] **2026/27 tax-rate tables** (personal allowance + taper, band widths,
      Class 2/4 NI) in `src/lib/tax/`.
- [ ] Sandbox-test MTD and VAT submissions end-to-end before enabling production.

## C. Real-device / manual testing (couldn't be done in the build env)

- [ ] **Biometric unlock** (WebAuthn PRF) on real iOS (Face/Touch ID), Android
      (fingerprint), and Windows Hello. Confirm enrol + unlock + passphrase
      fallback.
- [ ] **QR rendering** (new `qrcode` dependency) in a browser.
- [ ] **WebDAV backup** against a real Nextcloud/WebDAV server (CORS behaviour).
- [ ] **PDF/print** (invoices, statements) and the popup-blocker path.
- [ ] **Voice entry** (Web Speech API) on target browsers.
- [ ] **GPS mileage** foreground tracking on a phone.
- [ ] **Backup + restore** a real dataset across two devices using the recovery key.

## D. Owner decisions / fill-ins

- [ ] **Licence**: MIT (default) vs AGPL-3.0 — see LICENSE-DECISION.md. Fill in
      the copyright holder in `LICENSE`.
- [ ] **Contacts**: real `security@`, `conduct@`, and `support@` addresses
      (placeholders in SECURITY.md / CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md / support code).
- [ ] **Supporter tier**: paste your own payment links in `src/lib/supportConfig.ts`.
- [ ] **Business/brand**: confirm the motto and app name usage.

## E. Known limitations to communicate to users (already surfaced in-app)

- Lost recovery key / backup passphrase = unrecoverable data (inherent to E2E).
- Transactions aren't individually encrypted at rest in IndexedDB (attachments,
  some settings, and exports are). Device access is the trust boundary.
- Figures are PROVISIONAL — take them to a qualified accountant.
- AI runs on the user's OpenRouter key; figures pass to the chosen model per the
  user's OpenRouter data settings.

## F. Parked / backend-dependent (NOT blocking — future, supporter-funded)

- Live Open Banking bank feeds (regulated aggregator + backend).
- One-tap Google Drive / Dropbox / iCloud backup (OAuth needs a backend).
- Live read-only accountant share link (needs a backend).
- E2E-encrypted multi-device sync (fixes the single-device weakness).
- Full VAT transaction-level tracking (auto-calculates the 9 boxes).
- Full payroll; online payment gateways on invoices; conversational chat bot
  (the last also conflicts with the privacy model).

## G. Quality status at hand-off

- Whole-app syntax sweep: clean (200+ files).
- Library typecheck: clean (incl. crypto/backup/biometric).
- Logic self-tests passing: statements balance, VAT boxes, CIS, invoices,
  budgets, recurring, reconcile, quick-entry parser, rule-learning, smarter
  import, encrypted-backup round-trip (no plaintext leak, tamper-rejecting).
- Two QC passes done; all defects found were fixed and re-verified.
